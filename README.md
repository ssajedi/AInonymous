# SAiF-GPT

Project created for AECTech Hackathon 2023 @ New York.

SAiF-GPT aims to provide a solution for using Chat GPT in a secure and compliant manner, even when dealing with sensitive information. 
To ensure that corporate policies and NDAs are respected, the code and process automate entity detection and anonymization by replacing them with analogous values.
The end goal is to allow AEC industry to use AI technology like ChatGPT for document analysis while protecting confidential data.

The workflow consists of:
-

## Known Limitations
- 512 token limits on the Local LLM, limits size of uploaded.
- Some cases of misclasified entities. (However all entities are anonymized)


## Usage/Examples & Future development ideas
The application could be extended to anonymize additional patterns.
